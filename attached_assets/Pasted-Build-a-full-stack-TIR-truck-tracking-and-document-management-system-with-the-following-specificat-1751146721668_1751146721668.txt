Build a full-stack TIR (truck) tracking and document management system with the following specifications:

FRONTEND:
- Create a clean and responsive admin panel using React and Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap. It must be fully mobile- and desktop-compatible.
- The admin panel must include:
  - Create TIR profile (only phone number is required; plate, trailer plate, and location are optional).
  - Upload documents (PDF or image) with an optional category (T1, CMR, Invoice, Doctor Paper, Turkish Invoice). If no category is selected, document must go into "Other Documents".
  - Edit or delete any field or document.
  - Show "last updated" time (accurate to the second) on each TIR profile.
  - Create shareable read-only links per TIR profile.
  - Delete entire TIR (TRIP) profiles with a “Delete TRIP Profile” button, removing all data and associated documents from the database and Cloudinary.

- Add a main dashboard (home page) listing all existing TIRs (truck profiles).
  - Each TIR card must display basic info (phone, plate if exists, last updated).
  - Next to each TIR, include a “Share Profile” button that generates a read-only link to that specific TIR profile.
  - This list page must also be shareable via its own public link, listing all current TIRs (with limited fields and no edit rights).
  - Admin can deactivate or expire this list link at any time.

BACKEND:
- Use Express.js and Node.js to build the backend API.
- Use MongoDB Atlas (Free Tier) as the database.
  - Each TIR document includes: phone (required), plate, trailer_plate, location (optional), last_updated, list of documents, and shareable links.
  - Each document includes: file type (optional), Cloudinary URL, public_id, and upload timestamp.
- Use Cloudinary (Free Tier) to store uploaded documents (PDF or image). Store only the file URL and public_id in the database.

DOCUMENT CATEGORY:
- If a document type is selected (T1, CMR, etc.), display it in its category.
- If type is not selected, document must go to “Other Documents” by default.

SHAREABLE LINKS:
- For each TIR profile, allow generation of a read-only link that:
  - Shows only that TIR’s data (not others).
  - Is responsive, clean, and mobile friendly.
  - Displays last updated time and documents grouped by type.
  - Cannot be edited or changed by link visitor.
  - Link can be activated/deactivated or set with expiration time by admin.

- Also allow creating a public dashboard link that lists all TIR profiles (read-only, minimal info: phone, location, last_updated).
  - Only TIRs currently in the system must be visible.
  - Link can be turned on/off by admin or set to expire.

DELETION & CONTROL:
- “Delete TRIP Profile” must fully remove:
  - MongoDB document.
  - All related documents from Cloudinary (using stored public_id).
  - Any active shareable links.
- Admin can also delete or update individual fields or files manually.

SECURITY:
- Only admin can create/edit/delete data.
- All shared links are read-only and can only access the specific TIR or TIR list assigned.
- Visitors to shared links cannot access any other TIR data or the admin interface.

TOOLS:
- Use MongoDB Atlas (free) and Cloudinary (free).
- Deploy everything on Replit.
- All design must be clean, intuitive, and production-ready.

Only give me a working, clean, and deployed project on Replit that I can use immediately.
